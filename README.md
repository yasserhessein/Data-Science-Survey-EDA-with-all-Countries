### Data Description
* This year, as in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 we set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live from 09/01/2021 to 10/04/2021, and after cleaning the data we finished with 25,973 responses!

### Main Data:
kaggle_survey_2021_responses.csv: 42+ questions and 25,973 responses

* Responses to multiple choice questions (only a single choice can be selected) were recorded in individual columns. Responses to multiple selection questions (multiple choices can be selected) were split into multiple columns (with one column per answer choice).


### Supplementary Data:
kaggle_survey_2021_answer_choices.pdf: list of answer choices for every question
